# DriModel_Lab

>
This is some former attempts for the system aimed at research on how the status of transport stream influenced by a specific driving behavior which is defined by a model.
>

- We use PTV-VISSIM to get the status of transport stream.
- We use node.js to build a server.
- We use python to control PTV-VISSIM by COM interface.
- We consider to use DrivingModel.dll in PTV-VISSIM to control part of dirving behaviro.
- We use front-end tech to display the different influences between different models.
